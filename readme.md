## Background

I wanted to update a configuration setting using a workflow so that this can be a task that can just be forgotten about 

## Security concerns

You probably don't want to allow the actions bot write access across the whole repo and limit it as shown in the workflow.

You may require this being raised as a PR as opposed to pushed to the main branch
